This library solves the exercise 2 of the PHP Test.

The chosen algorithm is BTree. This algorithm was chosen because it offers a fast search time of O(log n).
Probably it wasn't the best choice due to its complexity and the short time given for implementation.

A better choice would have been a simpler algorithm with similar performance like Binary Search.

Library Documentation
---------------------

*Lib folder
    Contains the source code of the library.

*make_btree_from_dictionary.php
    This is a script that takes the example dictionary and builds the btree as an PHP object thats serialized and saved
    into btree_serialized.txt.
    If you dont want to run this script, you can uncompress the btree_serialized.txt.tar.gz file.

*benchmark.php
    Runs a small benchmark using the serialized Btree that can be built using make_btree_from_dictionary.php
